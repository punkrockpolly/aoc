"""
The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of
a sequence of single-character [actions] paired with [integer] input values.

0째 corresponds to north,
90째 angle corresponds to east,
180째 angle to south,
270째 to west

Action N means to move north by the given value.
Action S means to move south by the given value.
Action E means to move east by the given value.
Action W means to move west by the given value.

Action L means to turn left the given number of degrees.
Action R means to turn right the given number of degrees.
Action F means to move forward by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.

The ship starts by facing east.
Only the L and R actions change the direction the ship is facing.

Goal: At the end of these instructions, the ship's Manhattan distance
(sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position)
from its starting position is 17 + 8 = 25.
